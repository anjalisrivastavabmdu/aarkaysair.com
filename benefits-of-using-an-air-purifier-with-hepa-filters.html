Bad air quality is more dangerous for the people who have respiratory problems, or asthma or any types of breathing issues. Our indoor air quality can impact our health as much as the outdoor air quality does. That’s why it is more important nowadays to purify the air. These filters are one of the best purifiers to make our indoor air cleaner and more healthier and to remove airborne pollutants.
<br>HEPA filters help to trap even the smallest particles from the air and help in minimizing them from recirculating into the air. They are very helpful in maintaining the quality of air in houses, hospitals, and workplaces. In this blog we will be knowing the benefits of using a HEPA air purifier, the benefits of H13 HEPA filters, and how to choose the best filter.

                              <h2 class="hac text-danger mt-4">What is a HEPA Filter?</h2>
                              <p>It is known as the best air filtration device that could capture at least 99.97% of airborne particles at the size level of 0.3 microns. Different-sized particles are stopped in different ways by a HEPA filter. Large particles become caught because they are too massive to fit through the filter's openings. Smaller particles (such as germs) become adhered to the filter's fibers and are unable to flow through.
<br>The tiniest particles are also captured by diffusion; since they are so tiny, they flow in zigzag patterns rather than through the filter's openings, eventually becoming lodged in the fibers of the filter as well.Nanoparticles can even be captured by HEPA filters, which are incredibly effective. They are able to remove 99.95% of airborne particles because of this. 
HEPA filters are highly effective in clean rooms, medical facilities, buildings, and industries to improve air quality and reduce health risks.

                              <!-- Section 1 -->
                              <h3 class="hac text-danger mt-4">Types of HEPA Filters</h3>
                              <p>There are two major types of HEPA filters -
</p>
                              <p><b>Basic HEPA Filters</b> They are helpful in normal air filtration in homes and workplaces because they can catch dust particles as small as 0.3 microns.
</p>
                              
                            <p><b>H13 HEPA Filters</b> It is also known as medical-grade HEPA filters, they are the best filtration as they can trap 99.95% of particles as small as 0.1 microns, and it is best for respiratory issue sufferers, laboratories, and hospitals.</p>
                              
                                <p><b>5-Humidifiers/Dehumidifiers</b>The process of adding moisture to the supply air flow is called humidification. In colder places, where regular heating will make the air drier and lead to poor air quality, humidification is a necessity.</p>

<h2 class="hac text-danger mt-4">There are various types of AHUs, each designed for specific areas:</h2>
<p><b>1-Fresh Air Handling Unit</b>
It is a specific type of air handling system made typically to maintain and provide clean, filtered, and air-conditioned air into a structure. It is frequently found in HVAC (Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning) systems, especially in places where clean air is important, such as hotels, hospitals, and residential buildings.</p>

<p><b>2-Recirculating AHU</b> It is a part of an HVAC system that recycles interior air rather than depending just on fresh outdoor air to condition and distribute air within a structure. It is usually used in workplaces, shopping centers, medical facilities, and industrial settings where temperature control and energy economy are main concerns.</p>

<p><b>3-Packaged AHU</b>
It is a self-contained HVAC system designed to condition, filter, and distribute air in commercial and industrial buildings. Unlike traditional air handling units that require external components, a packaged AHU integrates essential elements such as heating, cooling, and filtration into a single unit, ensuring efficient air management.</p>

<p><b>4-Modular AHU</b>
It is a versatile and adaptable air handling system designed to meet specific HVAC requirements. Unlike conventional AHUs, modular AHUs are built in separate, customizable modules, allowing tailored solutions for industrial, commercial, and healthcare environments. Their flexibility makes them an ideal choice for spaces with unique ventilation and air quality needs.</p>

<!-- HEPA Filter Section -->
<h2 class="hac text-danger mt-4">What is H13 HEPA Filter?</h2>
<p>Usually known as medical-grade HEPA, H13 HEPA filters are part of a higher level of HEPA filtration. It is one of the best options for areas that need extremely pure air because of their best performance in removing even the tiniest airborne pollutants.</p>

<h3 class="hac">Benefits of H13 HEPA Filters</h3>
